<p>A Oaxacan Old Fashioned is a Mexican twist on an old favorite. Tequila comes in three forms, blanco, reposado, and anejo. Blanco is the clear tequila most people think of when you say tequila! Reposado means "rested", which is tequila blanco that has been rested in an oak barrel for 2 moths to no more than a year. Anejo, means aged, tequila that has been aged in oak barrels for 1-3 years!</p>.
